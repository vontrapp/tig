Installation instructions
-------------------------

Download a tarball from http://jonas.nitro.dk/tig/releases[] or clone the tig
repository http://jonas.nitro.dk/tig/tig.git[]. Documentation files are
available in the tarballs and in the 'release' branch of the tig repository.

The quick and simple way to install tig with documentation is to run:

	$ make
	$ make install install-doc

From tig's git repository it is also possible to install documentation directly
from the release branch to avoid installing the documentation tool chain:

	$ make install-release-doc

Optionally, you can use the `configure` script to detect dependencies:

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install

If your iconv library is not in the default library and include path, you'll
probably want to pass the "--with-libiconv" option to the "configure" script to
tell it where to look. Note, if you are building from the tig repository, you
need to first make the configure script:

	$ make configure

Build settings are read from the file "config.make". To manually configure tig
to use the ncurses library with wide character support, add the line:

	LDLIBS = -lncursesw

Release notes documenting notable changes are available in the NEWS file. When
upgrading, you are advised to also read them after you have completed the
installation.

The following tools and packages are needed:
